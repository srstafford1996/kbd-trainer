# KBD Trainer

A simple mini game for correct korean backdash inputs for Tekken

## Building

1. Install the SDL2 development libraries (ensure CMake can find them).
2. Create a new folder called `build` inside the project's root directory:

   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

3. Run CMake, pointing it to the project's root folder:

   ```
   cmake ..
   ```

4. Build the project:

   ```
   cmake --build .
   ```

5. (Optional) If tests or additional tools are included, run them from the build folder.

```

```
